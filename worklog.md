Task: Build AI Product Advisor popup — when user clicks product card, AI explains the product in a fun/influencer style before redirecting to shop

Work Log:
- Created /api/ai-explain route using z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM with Indonesian influencer-style system prompt
- Created ProductDetailDialog component with: product image, price, stats, AI advisor section with typewriter effect, "Beli di Shopee/Tokopedia" CTA button
- Updated ProductCard: added onClick prop, made card clickable (cursor-pointer), added e.stopPropagation() on "Beli Sekarang" button
- Integrated dialog into page.tsx with selectedProduct/detailOpen state
- All 3 card variants (featured, default, compact) now open dialog on click
- "Beli Sekarang" button still directly links to affiliate URL (bypasses dialog)
- Rebrand from BelanjaViral → JelajahBelanja completed across all files
- Fixed Prisma skipDuplicates incompatibility with SQLite
- Removed conflicting public/robots.txt (using route handler instead)

Stage Summary:
- AI Product Advisor works end-to-end: click product → dialog opens → AI explains in Indonesian influencer style with typewriter effect → "Beli di [Marketplace]" button goes to affiliate URL
- AI response quality verified: fun, casual Indonesian, uses "fyeuh", "gila sih", "worth it", etc.
- Affiliate links still auto-injected on all 80 products
- Type check: 0 errors in src/
- Brand fully rebranded to JelajahBelanja / jelajahbelanja.com

Task: Fix ProductDetailDialog — can't scroll, buy button hidden, close button hidden

Work Log:
- Root cause: DialogContent had overflow-hidden with no scrollable inner container
- Rewrote dialog layout: flex column with scrollable body + sticky bottom buy button
- Close button: sticky positioned at top of scroll area, always visible with bg-black/40 backdrop-blur
- Image: reduced height (h-48/h-56/h-64 responsive) to fit mobile screens
- Buy button: placed in flex-shrink-0 bottom section with border-top, always visible
- Added showCloseButton={false} to disable shadcn's default close button (conflicting with custom one)
- Added overscroll-contain for mobile scroll feel
- Removed duplicate positioning CSS that conflicted with shadcn DialogContent defaults

Stage Summary:
- Dialog now scrollable on all screen sizes
- Close button (X) always visible at top-right
- "Beli di [Marketplace]" button always visible at bottom
- AI advisor section scrolls naturally with content
- Type check clean, all APIs verified
