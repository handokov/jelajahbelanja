Task: Build AI Product Advisor popup — when user clicks product card, AI explains the product in a fun/influencer style before redirecting to shop

Work Log:
- Created /api/ai-explain route using z-ai-web-dev-sdk LLM with Indonesian influencer-style system prompt
- Created ProductDetailDialog component with: product image, price, stats, AI advisor section with typewriter effect, "Beli di Shopee/Tokopedia" CTA button
- Updated ProductCard: added onClick prop, made card clickable (cursor-pointer), added e.stopPropagation() on "Beli Sekarang" button
- Integrated dialog into page.tsx with selectedProduct/detailOpen state
- All 3 card variants (featured, default, compact) now open dialog on click
- "Beli Sekarang" button still directly links to affiliate URL (bypasses dialog)
- Rebrand from BelanjaViral → JelajahBelanja completed across all files
- Fixed Prisma skipDuplicates incompatibility with SQLite
- Removed conflicting public/robots.txt (using route handler instead)

Stage Summary:
- AI Product Advisor works end-to-end: click product → dialog opens → AI explains in Indonesian influencer style with typewriter effect → "Beli di [Marketplace]" button goes to affiliate URL
- AI response quality verified: fun, casual Indonesian, uses "fyeuh", "gila sih", "worth it", etc.
- Affiliate links still auto-injected on all 80 products
- Type check: 0 errors in src/
- Brand fully rebranded to JelajahBelanja / jelajahbelanja.com
